    "I decided to use two different classes as the primary purpose of classes is to use them in order to manage data more effectively. As we see from the problem, we are mainly handling two things, the node itself and the tree as a whole. Many of our methods revolve around transversing the whole tree and if we were to use only one class, it would make managing the node harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first class, \"Node\" is responsible only for managing the node itself and is called upon when we need to create an instance of the node class/an object. This allows us to pass information like the alphabet(data) easily and manage them. Moreover, this class does not have any methods of its own and it will specialize in managing the node itself. This is a good approach to separating the node from being modified accidentally when calling the methods later on because the methods are called on the tree and not the node itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second class \"Trie\" is responsible for managing the tree as a whole and it creates a trie tree and handles it as a whole. Morevoer, this class has methods that are used over the tree as a whole which allows us to have a specialized class which handles the entire tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach means that each problem has its own place in the code. The tree and the node are handled by two separate classes which is a nice intuitive approach to have further on as managing both at the same time does not seem like a good approach to code architecture and can cause confusion. It also makes it easier to maintain the code over longer times as classes are independent of each other and fix the code in case bugs are found. This approach also enables encapsulation. We can easily modify the data structures that are kept in the classes without affecting the user end of the code which still remains the same for the given methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using more classes initially also allows us to be prepared in the case that we need to change/modify classes later on. There can be cases where we need to act more methods/attributes to a certain class and starting with more classes initially which might be deemed unnecessary makes managing the code and growing it much easier later on. It also prevents us from having a jumbled up code which is harder to navigate by using this sort of data management."

    "Our next comparison is the insert methods. For a trie tree, this would be O(m) in all best, average, and worst cases. In the best case, the root node does not have any children or the trie tree has a word which is the same as the word you are inserting. In this case, the trie tree either makes all the nodes which takes O(m) time or it makes m comparisons with the children node to check the word already exists which is also O(m). The worst case is when the root node has all the alphabets other than the one you are inserting already present so you have to make 25 comparisons initially but since these comparisons are a one-time thing since after the first comparison the new node you made has no children so there will be no further cases of these comparisons, the comparisons on the first step will be ignored in the asymptotic generalization. Thus, the time complexity still remains O(m). For a BST, the best case of an insert is O(log n) which is when you have a node inserted to one side of the root node but it takes time complexity of O(log n) because half the nodes have to be eliminated. In the average case, the time complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the node in the tree. The worst case insertion is when it has to go through all the nodes to insert at the very end which makes the time complexity O(n). Thus, comparing the both trie trees have O(m) vs O(log n), O(h), and O(n) which as concluded above too means that the trie tree performs better in terms of time complexity than the BST for the insert methods too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at both the comparisons above, we can conclude that on average trie trees perform better than BSTs in both search and insert methods but if we have a case which is the best case for a BST but worst case for a trie tree, we will see both of them having the same performance as O(m) approaches O(log n) in the worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we need Trie trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Binary Search Tree is a dynamic representation of quicksort. The root is chosen and it is hoped that the root will not be too far off from the median if not the median itself. Then, all the values bigger will be on one side and all values on the left will be smaller than the root value which is analogous to the right and left subtrees of the BST. The left and right subtrees are again ordered in the same manner much like the choosing of a new root in the right and left sublists during quicksort to carry on the sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To carry this analogy forward into the Trie trees, we must first understand radix sort. Radix sort is a sorting algorithm where each of the bits of a number are compared to sort the input list rather than the numerical value of the number itself.\n",
    "Let's say we have a list [182, 170, 270, 080, 092, 013]. When doing radix sort, we focus on the bits which can be started from the left or the right. Let's say we start with the right bit so we will compare the 1 from 182 & 170, 2 from 270, and 0 from 080, 092, & 013. We see that 0 is the smallest so all three values are moved to the start of the list, elements with 1 as the first bit are moved next to them, and elements with 2 will be moved to the right most end. All these three are considered as separate sublists now and then we sort based on the next bit. Thus, we compare 8 from 080 with the other elements as 0 as their first bit, 7 from 172 to the other elements with 1 as their right most bit. As 270 is the only value with 2 as their right most element, we do not need to compare it to anything and it's position is considered final. The same process of moving based on numerical value of the bit is followed. Finally, we move on to the last bit where we compare any elements with the same 1st and 2nd bits. As we do not have any such element, the order achieved after the second sorting is considered final and we will get [013, 080, 092, 170, 182, 270]. This is how radix sort works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, taking this sorting style to the Trie trees. Trie trees work as visual representations of radix sort. There is no limit as to how many children one tree can have just like there can be any number of elements in the list with the same numerical value for that specific bit. A node in a trie tree can have any number of children from none to 26 if we are storing the alphabet. This can be bigger as well as we have special characters like \"á\". Thus, this is just like radix sort. Just like we do not compare values which have different numerical values for specific bits e.g. the second bits are not compared for elements with different first bits, we see the same pattern in trie trees where we do not have any comparison or anything between letters which do not have the same prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radix sorts are very useful when it comes to computer applications since the main problem is that every value must have the same number of bits. As a computer automatically allocates a certain number of bits to each variable type like all integers will have the same number of bits allocated in the memory and all characters will have the same number of bits allocated in the memory. Thus, radix sorting can be used in computer applications due to this form of memory allocation. This is why trie trees are useful. They are also very useful in applications like dictionaries with a lot of inputs with similar and different prefixes as they make storing data much more efficient thanks to not having to store each word and character separately. \n",
    "Thus, we can conclude that tries are much more useful when we have a large number of keys which do not require as much memory as they store data in a certain way. Moreover, one of the main advantages of trie trees is that as the maximum number of internal nodes from the root to the end of the word is the number of characters in the word, we do not need to care much about the balancing of the tree, one of the biggest concerns when we talk about BSTs."

    "I used recursion in the method that returns the list of words in the tree. When we are going over the tree, starting from the root everytime does not make sense. Not only does it mean that we will have more comparisons with the children but it also means that we will have to keep track of which node we were at, which word did we just append and whether there are other nodes going forward. This makes managing the method much harder and these are a lot of things to keep track of. Meanwhile, by using recursion, I was able to keep track of the word, the node we are at and make sure that the next call is not from the root but from the node we got the last word from, all without even having to manage it all myself. The recursion method also makes sure that we do not skip any branch in the tree and that we transverse through each node and branch to find all possible words in the tree, appending them all to a list.\n",

To this end, add a method to your code, **k_most_common()** that will take as an input k, an integer, and return a list of the k most common words from the dictionary within the trie. The structure of the output list should be such that each entry is a tuple, the first element being the word and the second an integer of its frequency (see docstring if you’re confused).\n",

    "One possible thing in my implementation that I would change is the way that the alphabetical list handles empty strings. As the root node is already an empty string, the Trie class gets confused about how to handle the input and it does not return an empty string like it should. This can be easily corrected with the use of a condition statement but writing a condition statement for such a rare occuring test does not seem like a good choice as it will take up memory. A better way of handling this could probably make this algorithm better.\n",

I felt like it was a nice representation of differentiating between the two because we have been doing sorting algoithms in extensive detail over the course of the semester and this was a really nice way to explain to someone how they differ. Moreover, this approach also enabled me to explain the concept of having multiple children under one node while that is not the case in other trees which I initially found hard to understand but I think this analogy made it much easier to understand.\n",

The points that we have discussed vigorously in classes like the time complexities of BST and quick sort were not described in detail but the points that we have not and were new concepts like radix sort and time complexities of Trie trees were described in detail in order to make sure that it was tailored to the appropriate audience. Moreover, with the code as well, the doc strings have been tailored in a way to make sure that anyone reading them with the same level of knowledge mentioned above will be able to understand it.\n",

    "#organization: My word descriptions have been arranged in a way that are easy to follow for the reader. An example of this could be when we were comparing the time complexities of Trie trees and BSTs. The time complexity of Trie trees was an unknown to us so I solved it first, followed it with the specific time complexity of BST which we have already discussed quite a lot in classes so I considered it common knowledge. Then, I moved on to the comparison. Similarly, when evaluating whether we need trie trees, I started by explaining BSTs, moved to explaining Trie trees, and then finally added the comparison in the sense of computers. As we have not discussed radix sort before, I also included a description of it to tailor it to the audience."
